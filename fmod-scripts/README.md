# Connecting Bank Events to Your Code

This script utilizes a very cool feature in FMOD Studio to give your code access to an always-up-to-date list of every event in your sound bank (using autocomplete!).

It does this by placing an `FmodConstants.hx` file next to your main `.hx` file, which you can then import into your project.

If you are using vscode, its autocomplete can be triggered by typing in "FmodSongs." or "FmodSFX."

## Features:
- Builds `FmodConstants.hx` in the project directory of your choosing
- Automatically builds your FMOD Studio sound bank after generating the constants file
- Can be triggered using the hotkey `Ctrl+B` while FMOD Studio is in focus (you can then use `Enter` to jump through the prompts quickly once the script is pointing at the right directory)

## Usage Examples:
- Play a song: `FmodManager.PlaySong(FmodSongs.MainSong);`
- Play a sound effect: `FmodManager.PlaySound(FmodSFX.CollectionCoin);`

## Auto-imports:

To avoid having to import three classes in every file of your game code, you can create an `import.hx` file next to your game's `Main.hx` to make the helpers globally available.

`import.hx`:
```haxe
// Only use imports when not in the macro context.
// The FMOD files use build macros and will throw errors if imported within the macro context.
#if !macro

// Fmod helper library
import haxefmod.FmodManager;
// Static class containing all sound effect names
import FmodConstants.FmodSFX;
// Static class containing all song names
import FmodConstants.FmodSongs;

#end
```

## Installing the script:
- Place the ExportHaxeConstants.js file in your FMOD Studio's "scripts" folder. This folder will be found wherever you installed FMOD Studio on your computer.
- In FMOD Studio, click the Scripts dropdown at the top and select "Reload".
- Click on the Scripts dropdown again and you will see an "Export Haxe Constants" option now available.
- When prompted, select the directory in your Haxe project that contains your `Main.hx` file (this is usually the `/source` directory).


**Note:** For your new constants file to stay up to date, this script must be run *every* time you build your sound bank (the script triggers the bank build for you!)
